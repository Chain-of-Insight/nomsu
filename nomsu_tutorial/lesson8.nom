### Loops and conditionals do *not* have their own scopes:
$z = 1
if (1 == 1):
    ### Set $z inside a conditional:
    $z = 2

### After assigning in a conditional, what should $z be?
test that ($z == (2))
for $ in (1 to 1):
    ### Set $z inside a loop:
    $z = 3

### After assigning in a loop, what should $z be?
test that ($z == (3))

say("OK!")
