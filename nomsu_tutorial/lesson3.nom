### When you need to do multiple things inside an action, use a block.
### Blocks are written with a colon followed by some indented code:
($x doubled then squared) means:
    $x = (2 * $x)
    $x = ($x * $x)
    return $x

### Blocks are also used for loops and conditionals:
for $num in [0, -1, 10, 4]:
    $correct_answer = (4 * ($num * $num))
    if (($num doubled then squared) != $correct_answer):
        fail "Wrong answer for \($num)!"

say("OK!")
