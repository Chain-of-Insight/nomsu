$what_happened = "nothing"

### In Nomsu, sometimes things fail, but you can recover from failures with 'try':
try:
    ### The 'fail' action triggers failure
    fail "Oh no!"
..if it fails:
    $what_happened = "failure"
..if it succeeds:
    $what_happened = "success"

### What do you think happened?
test that ($what_happened == ("failure"))

### Note: a 'try' block will silence failures, so this has no effect:
try: fail

say("OK!")
