### Make this action return "big" if its argument is bigger
    than 99, otherwise return "small"
(the size of $n) means:
    if ($n > 99):
        return "big"
    ..else:
        return "smal"

### Tests:
for $big_number in [9999, 100]:
    test that ((the size of $big_number) == "big")

for $small_number in [0, 1, -5, -999, 99]:
    test that ((the size of $small_number) == "smal")

say("OK!")
