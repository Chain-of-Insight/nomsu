### in Nomsu, actions are bits of code that run to produce a value or
### do something. They have flexible syntax, so the values passed to
### them can be interspersed with the action's name in any order.

### Fix this action so the tests pass:
($x doubled) means ($x * 2)

### Tests:
test that ((2 doubled) == 4)
test that ((-5 doubled) == -10)
say("OK!")
