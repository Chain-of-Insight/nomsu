#..
    Tests for the stuff defined in core/control_flow.nom

use "core"

assume (all of [inf, pi, tau, golden ratio, e]) or barf "math constants failed"
%nan <- (NaN)
assume (%nan != %nan) or barf "NaN failed"
assume (("5" as a number) = 5)
assume
    all of [..]
        abs 5, |5|, sqrt 5, âˆš(5), sine 5, cosine 5, tangent 5, arc sine 5, arc cosine 5,
        arc tangent 5, arc tangent 5/10, hyperbolic sine 5, hyperbolic cosine 5,
        hyperbolic tangent 5, e^5, ln 5, log base 2 of 5, floor 5, ceiling 5, round 5,
..or barf "math functions failed"
assume ((463 to the nearest 100) = 500) or barf "rounding failed"
assume ((2.6 to the nearest 0.25) = 2.5) or barf "rounding failed"
assume ((min of [3,-4,1,2] by % = (%*%)) = 1)
assume ((max of [3,-4,1,2] by % = (%*%)) = -4)

say "Math test passed"
